# Motivation & Definition

Let $M$ be a model of a first-order theory $T$. What are the possible first-order properties satisfied elements (or tuples) in $M$?

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $n\geq0$. An *$n$-type* is a set $p(\bar{v})$ of $L$-formulas such that the $L_\bar{v}$-theory $p(\bar{v})\cup\Th M$ is satisfiable.{{< /env >}}
