``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Fix $x\in\R$. A sequence $\tpl{x_n}_{n\in\N}$ in $\R$ is said to <b>converge to $x$</b>, and $x$ is said to be the <b>limit of $\tpl{x_n}$</b>, if
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa\epsilon>0,\fa^\infty n\in\N:\l|x_n-x\r|<\epsilon,
\end{equation}$$
in which case we write $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}x_n=x$ or $x_n\to x$ as $n\to\infty$.
