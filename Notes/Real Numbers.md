``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

A totally ordered field $\tpl{R,+,\cdot,0,1,<}$ is said to be an <b>ordered field of real numbers</b> if $\tpl{R,<}$ is Dedekind-complete.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Since any two models of the real numbers are isomorphic, we shall call any model thereof the <b>real numbers</b> and denote it by $\R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
