title: Definition.

_Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets. We say $X$ is **isomorphic to $Y$ as sets** if there exists an invertible function $f:X\to Y$, in which case $f$ is said to be a **set isomorphism**._

```

**Remark.** Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $X\iso Y$ and say that $X$ and $Y$ are **isomorphic as sets**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
