# Motivation & Definition

{{< link file="group" display="Groups" type="references" >}} capture $-$ *abstractly* $-$ the notion of a symmetry. But symmetries are also present in concrete objects, with different kinds of objects preserving different kinds of structure. The concept of a *group action* connects the two.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $G$ be a group and fix a {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}} $C$. A **$G$-action** is a {{< link file="functor" display="functor" type="references" >}} $\cat{B}G\to C$, which specifies an object $X\in C$ and a homomorphism $\phi:G\to\Aut X$.

{{< /env >}}

Thus a group action is specified by the data of a tuple $\tpl{X,\phi}$, which we usually write as $\phi:G\act X$. The object $X$ is the concrete object, and $\phi$ encodes how $G$ manifests itself as $\Aut X$, the symmetries of $X$. Note, however, that $\phi$ need not be injective.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Taking $C\coloneqq\catset$ recovers the usual notion of a group acting on a set, in which case $\Aut X$ are just the permutations of $X$. With $X$ as the underlying set of $G$, we have the canonical *left-multiplication* action given by $\phi(g)x\coloneqq g\cdot x$.

## Basic Notions

For a group action $\phi:G\act X$ with $X$ in a {{< link file="concrete_category" display="concrete category" type="references" >}}, we make the following definitions.
* For a fixed $x\in X$, the *orbit* of $x$ is $Gx\coloneqq\l\\{gx\in X\st g\in G\r\\}$ and the *stabilizer* of $x$ is $G_x\coloneqq\l\\{g\in G\st gx=x\r\\}$. They are related by the {{< link file="orbit_stabilizer_theorem" display="Orbit Stabilizer Theorem" type="properties" >}} and, usually when $G$ is finite, the {{< link file="the_class_equation" display="Class Equation" type="properties" >}}. Clearly, $\ker\phi=\bigcap_xG_x$.
* We say that the action is *transitive* if for all $x,y\in X$, there is some $g\in G$ such that $gx=y$. Note that $X\iso\bigsqcup\_iGx_i$, and since $G$ always acts transitively on its orbits, every group action decomposes into its transitive components (i.e. orbits).
* We say that the action is *faithful* if $\phi$ is injective, so that $G\into\Aut X$, and *free* if $gx=x$ for some $x\in X$ implies $g=e$. {{< link file="cayleys_theorem" display="Cayleyâ€™s Theorem" type="properties" >}} is the statement that the left-multiplication action is faithful.

## Categorical Aspects

Since group actions are functors, it makes sense to consider {{< link file="natural_transformation" display="natural transformations" type="references" >}} between two actions $\phi:G\act X$ and $\psi:G\act Y$ $-$ called *$G$-maps* $-$ which defines the category of $G$-actions.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;More generally, we can $-$ in the definition $-$ replace $G$ with a {{< link file="group_object" display="group object" type="references" >}} in $C$, giving us {{< link file="continuous_group_action" display="continuous group actions" type="examples" >}}, {{< link file="lie_group_action" display="Lie group actions" type="examples" >}}, etc; the definitions above carry forth with obvious modifications.

# Rigidity of Actions

Many important properties of $G$ can be deduced by exhibiting an action on some space $X$ (or showing non-existence thereof). Some examples include <span style="color:red">???</span>.
