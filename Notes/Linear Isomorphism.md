``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $V$ and $W$ be $K$-vector spaces. We say that $V$ and $W$ are <b>linearly isomorphic</b> if there exists an invertible linear map $T:V\to W$, called a <b>linear isomorphism</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That is, linear isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catvect$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $V\iso W$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
