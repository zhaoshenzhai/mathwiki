# Statement and Proof

\begin{theorem}

Let $X$ be a metric space. If $K\subeq X$ is \ref[compact]{compact_space}, then $K$ is bounded.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Fix $x\in X$ and consider the open cover $\l\\{B_n(x)\st n\in\N\r\\}$ of $K$. By compactness of $K$, there exists $n_1,\dots,n_m$ such that $K\subeq\bigcup_{i\leq n}B_{n_i}(x)$, and hence $K$ is bounded.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

\end{proof}
