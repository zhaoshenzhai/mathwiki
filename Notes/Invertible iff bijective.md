_Let $f:X\to Y$. Then $f$ is a bijection iff it is invertible._

```

_Proof_. ($\Rightarrow$): Since $f$ is a bijection, it is both an injection and a surjection, so there exist left and right-inverses $g,h:Y\to X$ of $f$, respectively. It follows that $g=h$ and thus $g$ is both a left and a right-inverse of $f$. Therefore, $f$ is invertible.

($\Leftarrow$): Since $f$ is invertible, $f$ has both a left and right-inverse so $f$ is both injective and surjective. It follows, by definition, that $f$ is bijective.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
