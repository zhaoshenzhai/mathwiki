title: Definition.

_Let $R$ be a binary relation and let $S$ be a set. The **image of $S$ under $R$** is the set_
$$\begin{equation}
    \im_R\l(S\r)\coloneqq R\l[S\r]\coloneqq\ran\l(R\rest S\r).
\end{equation}$$

```

**Remark.** Expanding, we see that $\im_R\l(S\r)=\l\{y\mid\ex x\in S:xRy\r\}$. Usually, the set $S$ is a subset of $\dom R$. Observe that $\im_R\l(\dom R\r)=\ran R$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
