``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $\tpl{G,\ast,e}$ be a group. Then, for all $g\in G$, there exists a unique $h\in G$ such that $g\ast h=e=h\ast g$._

```

_Proof_. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that $h,h'\in G$ are both inverses of $g$; that is, suppose
$$\begin{equation}
    g\ast h=e=h\ast g\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{and}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ g\ast h'=e=h'\ast g
\end{equation}$$
for all $g\in G$. In particular, we have $g\ast h=g\ast h'$, so the result follows from the cancellation laws.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
