``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be an ordered set generated by the total order $<$. Then, for any $a,b\in X$, the closed interval $\l[a,b\r]$ is closed in $\mc{T}$._

```

_Proof_. Observe that $\l[a,b\r]=X\comp\l(\l(-\infty,a\r)\cup\l(b,+\infty\r)\r)$ which is the complement of a union of two open sets in $\mc{T}$ and is hence a complement of an open set in $\mc{T}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
