# Motivation & Definition

\begin{definition}

A _group_ is a tuple $(G,m,\iota,e)$ consisting of a set $G$, a binary operation $m:G^2\to G$ written $gh\coloneqq m(g,h)$, a unary operation $\iota:G\to G$ written $g^{-1}\coloneqq\iota(g)$, and a constant $e\in G$, satisfying the following conditions.
* (Associativity). For all $g,h,k\in G$, we have $(gh)k=g(hk)$.
* (Identity). For all $g$, we have $ge=e=eg$.
* (Inverse). For all $g$, we have $g\iota(g)=e=\iota(g)g$.
