# Motivation & Definition

Let $X$ be a set. We would like to formalize a notion of ‘closeness’ between two points without necessarily referring to a specific {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="references" >}}, but rather, via certain subsets of $X$ called *open sets*. One can think of these open sets as specifying ‘proximity’ without necessarily satisfying the triangle inequality.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The following definition is motivated by some properties {{< link file="metric_space_generates_a_topology" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} of open sets generated by a metric $d$ on $X$, which we now axiomatize.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $X$ be a set. A **topology** on $X$ is a family $\mc{T}_X\subseteq\pow(X)$, whose elements are called **open sets**, subject to the following conditions.
1. <span style="color:gray">(Non-trivial).</span> $\em$ and $X$ are in $\mc{T}_X$.
2. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under $\cup$).</span> For any $\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{T}_X$, we have $\bigcup\mc{U}\in\mc{T}_X$.
3. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under finite $\cap$).</span> For any $U_1,U_2\in\mc{T}_X$, we have $U_1\cap U_2\in\mc{T}_X$.

If $\mc{T}_X$ is a topology on $X$, we call the pair $\tpl{X,\mc{T}_X}$ a **topological space**.

Similarly, continuity of functions between metric spaces {{< link file="continuous_function_metric" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} motivative the following

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A function $f:X\to Y$ between topological spaces is **continuous** if for any open subset $V\subseteq Y$, its preimage $f^{-1}(V)\subseteq X$ is open too.

## Basic Notions

For a topological space $\tpl{X,\mc{T}_X}$, we let $\mc{F}_X\coloneqq\l\\{X\comp U\st U\in\mc{T}_X\r\\}$ denote its collection of *closed* sets. By De Morgan’s Laws, a topology is equivalently given by a family $\mc{F}_X\ni\em,X$ closed under intersections and finite unions.

&emsp;&emsp;As with any field of math, topology comes with it a baggage of jargon; a (non-exhaustive) list include the {{< link file="closure_topology" display="closure" type="constructions" >}} and {{< link file="interior_topology" display="interior" type="constructions" >}} of a subset $A\subseteq X$; its {{< link file="accumulation_point" display="accumulation" type="constructions" >}}, {{< link file="limit_point" display="limit" type="constructions" >}}, {{< link file="cluster_point" display="cluster" type="constructions" >}}, and {{< link file="boundary" display="boundary" type="constructions" >}} points; and whether it is {{< link file="dense_topology" display="dense" type="constructions" >}} or {{< link file="nowhere_dense" display="nowhere dense" type="constructions" >}}.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Most importantly, topological spaces allow us to speak about {{< link file="convergence" display="convergence" type="constructions" >}}, which can be rephrased in terms of {{< link file="convergence" display="nets" type="references" section="Nets" >}}/{{< link file="filter" display="filters" type="references" mod="space" >}}. For ‘nicer’ spaces (e.g. metric spaces), it can be rephrased using just sequences.

## The Category $\cattop$

With continuous functions as morphisms, topological spaces form a {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}} $\cattop$; by convention, isomorphisms in $\cattop$ are called *homeomorphisms* (which are not {{< link file="continuous_bijection_homeomorphism" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} merely bijective continuous functions). Most importantly, $\cattop$ is {{< link file="cattop_is_complete" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} {{< link file="complete_(category_theory)" display="complete" type="references" >}}, witnessed by the standard constructions of products, coproducts, subobjects, and quotients.

# Examples & Generalizations

## Types of Spaces

Beyond the generalities above, much more can be said about specific types of topological spaces.

* {{< link file="Hausdorff_space" display="Hausdorff" type="types" >}} spaces (and more generally spaces satisfying some {{< link file="separation_axioms" display="Separation" type="types" >}} axioms), exclude a lot of pathologies present in general topological spaces.
* {{< link file="compact_space" display="Compact" type="types" >}} spaces exhibit many properties of finite sets, and are therefore really nice to work with.
* {{< link file="connected_space" display="Connectedness" type="types" >}} and other related concepts like {{< link file="path-connected_space" display="path-connectedness" type="types" >}} help establish global properties of topological spaces.
* {{< link file="separable_space" display="Separable" type="types" >}} and {{< link file="first_countable_space" display="$1^\textrm{st}$" type="types" >}}/{{< link file="second_countable_space" display="$2^\textrm{nd}$" type="types" mod="space" >}} countable spaces are countable objects (in flavour), giving way to techniques from {{< link file="real_analysis" display="analysis" type="references" >}}. This is especially the case for {{< link file="polish_space" display="Polish" type="types" >}} spaces.
* {{< link file="sequential_space" display="Sequential" type="types" >}} spaces allow topological properties (like convergence, continuity, and compactness etc) to be probed by sequences, much like as in {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="types" >}} spaces.
* {{< link file="manifold" display="Manifolds" type="types" >}} allow many important properties specific to $\R^n$ to be ‘lifted’ back to the topological space. We can thus ‘do calculus’ on {{< link file="smooth_manifold" display="smooth manifolds" type="types" >}}.

## Structures on Spaces

One may also equip topological spaces with additional structure(s), leading to richer theories. Some are more algebraic in flavor ({{< link file="topological_group" display="topological groups" type="structures" mod="space" >}}, {{< link file="topological_ring" display="rings" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="topological_vector_space" display="vector spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.), some more geometric ({{< link file="smooth_manifold" display="smooth" type="structures" mod="space" >}}/{{< link file="complex_manifold" display="complex" type="structures" mod="space" >}} manifolds, etc.), and others are both ({{< link file="lie_group" display="Lie groups" type="structures" mod="space" >}}, {{< link file="ringed_space" display="ringed spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.).
