# Motivation & Definition

Let $X$ be a set. We would like to formalize a notion of ‘closeness’ between two points without necessarily referring to a specific {{< link file="metric_space" display="metric" type="references" >}}, but rather, via certain subsets of $X$ called *open sets*. One can think of these open sets as specifying ‘proximity’ without necessarily satisfying the triangle inequality.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;The following definition is motivated by some properties{{< link file="metric_space_generates_a_topology" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} of open sets generated by a metric $d$ on $X$, which we now axiomatize. It can also be motivated{{< link file="topological_space" type="references" mod="dag" section="Open $\Leftrightarrow$ Semi-decidable" >}} by viewing open sets as {{< link file="semi_decidable" display="semi-decidable" type="references" >}} properties.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $X$ be a set. A *topology* on $X$ is a family $\mc{T}_X\subseteq\pow(X)$, whose elements are called *open sets*, subject to the following conditions.
1. <span style="color:gray">(Non-trivial).</span> $\em$ and $X$ are in $\mc{T}_X$.
2. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under $\cup$).</span> For any $\mc{U}\subseteq\mc{T}_X$, we have $\bigcup\mc{U}\in\mc{T}_X$.
3. <span style="color:gray">(Closure under finite $\cap$).</span> For any $U_1,U_2\in\mc{T}_X$, we have $U_1\cap U_2\in\mc{T}_X$.

If $\mc{T}_X$ is a topology on $X$, we call the pair $\tpl{X,\mc{T}_X}$ a *topological space*.

{{< /env >}}

Similarly, continuity of functions between metric spaces{{< link file="continuous_function_metric" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} motivative the following

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A function $f:(X,\mc{T}_X)\to(Y,\mc{T}_Y)$ is *continuous* if for any $V\in\mc{T}_Y$, we have $f^{-1}(V)\in\mc{T}_X$.

{{< /env >}}

That is, $f$ is continuous if ‘preimages of open sets are open’.

## Basic Notions

Topology comes with it a baggage of jargon; a (non-exhaustive) list include the {{< link file="closure_topology" display="closure" type="constructions" >}} and {{< link file="interior_topology" display="interior" type="constructions" >}} of a subset $A\subseteq X$; its {{< link file="accumulation_point" display="accumulation" type="constructions" >}}, {{< link file="limit_point" display="limit" type="constructions" >}}, {{< link file="cluster_point" display="cluster" type="constructions" >}}, and {{< link file="boundary" display="boundary" type="constructions" >}} points; and whether it is {{< link file="dense_topology" display="dense" type="constructions" >}} or {{< link file="nowhere_dense" display="nowhere dense" type="constructions" >}}. They can also be generated (i.e., completely determined) by smaller collections of open sets thereof, via {{< link file="bases_for_topologies" display="(sub)bases" type="sufficiencies" >}}.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;More importantly, topological spaces allow us to speak of {{< link file="convergence" display="convergence" type="constructions" >}}, which can be phrased in terms of {{< link file="convergence" display="nets" type="references" section="Nets" >}}/{{< link file="filter" display="filters" type="references" >}}. For ‘nice’ spaces (e.g. metric spaces), it can be rephrased using just sequences.

## The Category $\cattop$

With continuous functions as morphisms, topological spaces form a {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}} $\cattop$; by convention, isomorphisms in $\cattop$ are called *homeomorphisms* (which are not{{< link file="continuous_bijection_homeomorphism" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} merely bijective continuous functions). Most importantly, $\cattop$ is{{< link file="cattop_is_complete" type="justifications" mod="dag" >}} {{< link file="complete_(category_theory)" display="complete" type="references" >}}, witnessed by the standard constructions of products, coproducts, subobjects, and quotients.

## Open $\Leftrightarrow$ Semi-decidable

Topology can be interpreted as an ‘idealized version of computation’, where spaces correspond to data types, open sets correspond to observable properties, and continuous maps correspond to computable functions.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Computationally, an observable property $V\subseteq Y$ gives rise to a semi-decidable map $\chi_V:Y\to\tt{Unit}$, where $\chi_V(y)$ returns $\tt{()}$ of type $\tt{Unit}$ if $y\in V$, and runs forever otherwise. If $f:X\to Y$ is computable, then $\chi_V\circ f:X\to\tt{Unit}$ is semi-decidable.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;In topological language, $\tt{Unit}$ corresponds to the Sierpinski space, whose open point is $\tt{()}$ and whose closed point is non-termination. An observable property $V\subseteq Y$ is then an open set, with $\chi_V$ its characteristic function, so that for a continuous map $f:X\to Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(V)$ is open if $V$ is.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Observable properties are interpreted as open sets $-$ rather than closed sets $-$ to reflect how they behave under unions and intersections. If $\l\\{U_\alpha\r\\}$ is a collection of observable properties, then $\bigcup_\alpha U_\alpha$ is observable since we can run each $\chi_{U_\alpha}$ in parallel and output $\tt{()}$ if one of $\chi_{U_\alpha}$ does. On the other hand, $\bigcap_\alpha U_\alpha$ need *not* be observable since $\chi_{\bigcap_\alpha U_\alpha}$ outputs $\tt{()}$ iff *every* $\chi_{U_\alpha}$ does, so it fails to be observable if the $\chi_{U_\alpha}$’s take arbitrarily long (but finite) times to terminate.

# Examples & Generalizations

## Types of Spaces

Beyond the generalities above, much more can be said about specific types of topological spaces.

* {{< link file="Hausdorff_space" display="Hausdorff" type="types" >}} spaces exclude a lot of pathologies present in general topological spaces.
* {{< link file="compact_space" display="Compact" type="types" >}} spaces exhibit many properties of finite sets, and are therefore really nice to work with.
* {{< link file="connected_space" display="Connectedness" type="types" >}} and other related concepts like {{< link file="path-connected_space" display="path-connectedness" type="types" >}} help establish global properties of topological spaces.
* {{< link file="separable_space" display="Separable" type="types" >}} and {{< link file="first_countable_space" display="$1^\textrm{st}$" type="types" >}}/{{< link file="second_countable_space" display="$2^\textrm{nd}$" type="types" >}} countable spaces are countable objects (in flavour), giving way to techniques from {{< link file="real_analysis" display="analysis" type="references" >}}.
* {{< link file="metrizable_space" display="Metrizable" type="types" >}} spaces, and more specifically {{< link file="polish_space" display="Polish" type="types" >}} spaces, inherit all the nice topological properties of metric spaces.
* {{< link file="sequential_space" display="Sequential" type="types" >}} spaces allow topological properties (like convergence, continuity, and compactness etc) to be probed by sequences.
* {{< link file="manifold" display="Manifolds" type="types" >}} allow many properties of $\R^n$ to be ‘lifted’ back to the topological space. We can thus ‘do calculus’ on {{< link file="smooth_manifold" display="smooth manifolds" type="types" >}}.

## Structures on Spaces

One may also equip topological spaces with additional structure(s), leading to richer theories. Some are more algebraic in flavor ({{< link file="topological_group" display="topological groups" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="topological_ring" display="rings" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="topological_vector_space" display="vector spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.), some more geometric ({{< link file="smooth_manifold" display="smooth" type="structures" >}}/{{< link file="complex_manifold" display="complex" type="structures" >}} manifolds, etc.), and others are both ({{< link file="lie_group" display="Lie groups" type="structures" >}}, {{< link file="ringed_space" display="ringed spaces" type="structures" >}}, etc.).
