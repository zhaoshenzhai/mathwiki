title: Definition.

_A ring $\tpl{R,+,\cdot,0}$ is said to be a **field** if it is a commutative division ring with unit._

```

**Remark.** Every field is an integral domain, for take $r,s\in R$ such that $rs=0$. Suppose that $r\neq0$. Then, being a division ring, we see that there exists some $r^{-1}\in R$ such that $r^{-1}r=1$. Observe then that $r^{-1}\l(rs\r)=\l(r^{-1}r\r)s=1s=s$, but since $rs=0$, we have that $s=0$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
