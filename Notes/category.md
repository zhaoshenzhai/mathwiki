# Motivation & Definition

The starting point of the theory of *categories* is the observation that many properties of mathematical objects can be more succinctly expressed as diagrams of arrows $-$ as opposed to an equation $-$ and that many objects can be constructed via a ‘universal property’ of such a diagram; heuristically then, these objects are characterized as the ‘most efficient solution to a certain optimization problem’.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp; To formalize this, we need a general framework for composing arrows, so we make the following

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A *category* $C$ consists of a class $\mc{O}$ of *objects*, and,
* for any two objects $x,y\in\mc{O}$, a class $C(x,y)$ of *morphisms* in $C$;
* for any object $x\in\mc{O}$, an *identity* morphism $1_x\in C(x,x)$,
* for any three objects $x,y,z\in\mc{O}$, a *composition map*
$$\begin{equation}
    \circ:C(y,z)\times C(x,y)\to C(x,z);
\end{equation}$$

subject to the following conditions.
* <span style="color:gray">(Associativity).</span> For all morphisms $f,g,h$ in the configuration
$$\begin{equation}
    x\overset{f}{\rightarrow}y\overset{g}{\rightarrow}z\overset{h}{\rightarrow}w,
\end{equation}$$
we have $h\circ(g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$.
* <span style="color:gray">(Unit).</span> For all morphisms $f\in C(x,y)$, we have $f\circ1\_x=f=1\_y\circ f$.
