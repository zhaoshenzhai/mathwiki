# Motivation & Definition

A very crude measure of the local complexity of a simple {{< link file="graph.md" display="graph" type="references" >}} is the *degree* of a vertex. Nevertheless, it often forms the basis of some interesting combinatorial properties of {{< link file="finite_graph.md" display="finite graphs" type="references" >}}, and, more importantly, it bounds the local complexity of {{< link file="infinite_graphs.md" display="infinite graphs" type="references" >}}.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $G$ be a simple graph and fix $v\in V$. The *degree* of $v$ is the {{< link file="cardinal" display="cardinality" type="references" >}} $d_G(v)$ of all edges $e\in E(G)$ at $v$.
