title: Definition.

_Let $V$ and $W$ be vector spaces over some field $K$. We say that $V$ is **linearly isomorphic to $W$** if there exists a linear isomorphism $T:V\to W$._

```

**Remark.** Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $V\iso W$ and say that $V$ and $W$ are **linearly isomorphic**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
