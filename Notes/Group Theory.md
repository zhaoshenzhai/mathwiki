$\huge\rm\bf{G}\normalsize\rm\bf{ROUP THEORY}$ is the study of the [category of groups](obsidian://open?file=TODO); that is, the study of [groups](Group.md) and [homomorphisms](Group%20Homomorphism.md) between them.

**Constructions.** As with most categories, $\catgrp$ has [subobjects](Subgroup.md), [products](External%20Direct%20Product%20(Group).md), [direct sums](obsidian://open?file=TODO), and [quotients](Quotient%20Group.md). Unique to Group Theory is the concept of a [normal subgroup](Normal%20Subgroup.md) $N\nsubgrpeq G$, defined as subgroups that are [stable](Normal%20iff%20stable%20under%20conjuation.md) under [conjugation](Conjugate%20slash%20conjugacy%20class.md). These are precisely the subgroups that furnishes a compatible group structure on its quotient.

Similarly, as with most categories, we can define the [kernel](Kernel%20(Group%20Theory).md) and the image of a [homomorphism](Group%20Homomorphism.md) $\phi:G\to H$. Furthermore, $\ker\phi\nsubgrpeq G$, so $\phi$ [decomposes](Canonical%20Decomposition%20of%20Group%20Homomorphisms.md) into

which, in particular, implies the [Isomorphism Theorems](obsidian://open?file=TODO).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Characterizations.** As with most categories, groups are [identified](Isomorphic%20Groups.md) up to [isomorphism](Group%20Isomorphism.md). A crude estimate is given by [Cayley$\textrm{'}$s Theorem](Cayley's%20Theorem.md), which states that every group is isomorphic to a [permutation group](Permutation%20Group.md). However, permutation groups are very rich, so we restrict to [cyclic](Cyclic%20Group.md) or [Abelian](Abelian%20Group.md) groups.
* The [Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups](obsidian://open?file=TODO) states that every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime-power order.
* In turn, every cyclic group [is isomorphic to](Cyclic%20groups%20are%20Z%20or%20Zn.md) to either $\Z$ or $\Z_n\coloneqq\Z/n\Z$ (the [additive group of integers modulo $n$](Additive%20Group%20of%20Integers%20mod%20n.md)).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Computations.** Courtesy of the Fundamental Theorem, most computations in Abelian groups boil down to arithmetic in $\Z$ or $\Z_n$. Indeed, the former [is a PID](Ring%20of%20integers%20is%20a%20PID.md) and the latter [is a field $\Leftrightarrow$ $n$ is prime](Integers%20mod%20n%20is%20a%20field%20iff%20n%20prime.md), so their arithmetic is particularly simple.
* Furthermore, [$\Z_n$ is generated by](Generates%20additive%20group%20of%20integers%20mod%20n%20iff%20relatively%20prime.md) any element $\l[m\r]\in\Z_n$ such that $m\perp n$, and [it decomposes into](Decomposition%20of%20additive%20group%20of%20integers%20mod%20n%20if%20relatively%20prime.md) $\Z_k\times\Z_l$ if $k\perp l$ and $m=kl$. It also has a ring structure from which one obtains its [group of units](Multiplicative%20Group%20of%20Integers%20mod%20n.md), [Euler$\textrm{'}$s Totient Function](Euler's%20Totient%20Function.md), and their connection via [Euler$\textrm{'}$s Theorem](Euler's%20Theorem.md).
* The [order](Order%20(Group%20Theory).md) of a group element $g\in G$, defined as the smallest $n\in\N^+$ such that $g^n=e$, allows us to compute generating elements for cyclic groups. Indeed, for the [cyclic subgroup](Cyclic%20Subgroup.md) $\l\langle g\r\rangle\subseteq G$, we have that [$\ord{g}=\ord{\l\langle g\r\rangle}$](Order%20of%20group%20element%20is%20order%20of%20generated%20cyclic%20group.md).

For [finite groups](Finite%20Group.md), one may use [Lagrange$\textrm{'}$s Theorem](Lagrange's%20Theorem.md) to calculate the [index](Index.md) of a subgroup $H\subseteq G$, defined as the number of left/right [cosets](Coset.md) of $H$ in $G$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
