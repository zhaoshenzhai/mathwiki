title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group and take $g\in G$. If there exists some $n\in\N^+$ such that $g^n=e$, then $g$ is said to have <b>finite order</b>, in which case the <b>order of $g$</b> is
$$\begin{equation}
    \l|g\r|\coloneqq\min\l\{n\in\N^+\st g^n=e\r\}.
\end{equation}$$
Otherwise, $g$ is said to have <b>infinite order</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> We define the <b>order of $G$</b> to be its cardinality $\l|G\r|$. By Lagrange’s Theorem, we see that $g^{\l|G\r|}=e$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
