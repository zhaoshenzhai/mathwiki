# Definition and Generation

A standard method of studying an object, in this case, a {{< link file="group" display="group" type="references" >}} $G$, is to analyze other groups that ‘sit inside’ $G$. This is formalized in the following

{{< env type="definition" >}}

Let $G$ be a group. A *subgroup* of $G$ is a subset $H\subseteq G$ equipped with the unique group structure making the inclusion $H\into G$ a group homomorphism. <span style="color:gray">[We write $H\substructeq G$ to indicate that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.]</span>

{{< /env >}}

Note that any sub*set* $H\subseteq G$ inherits the operation from $G$, and makes it a sub*group* iff said operation is closed. The closure condition can be simplified to only requiring that $gh^{-1}\in H$ for all $g,h\in H$.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;From a model-theoretic point of view, subgroups of $G$ are simply {{< link file="substructure" display="substructures" type="generalizations" >}}, viewed as a {{< link file="model" display="model" type="references" >}} of the {{< link file="group" display="theory of groups" type="references" section="The Theory $T_\textrm{Grp}$" >}}.

## Subgroup Generation

Given a subset $A\subseteq G$, the subgroup *generated* by $A$ is the smallest subgroup $H\substructeq G$ containing $A$. It is clearly unique, and is thus denoted by $\gen{A}$. Such a group can be realized in many ways.
* <span style="color:gray">(Element).</span> The most direct group-theoretic construction is simply letting
$$\begin{equation}
    \gen{A}\coloneqq\l\\{g\in G\st g=a_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots a_n^{\epsilon_n}\textrm{ for some }a_1,\dots,a_n\in A\textrm{ and }\epsilon_1,\dots,\epsilon_n=\pm1\r\\}
\end{equation}$$
be the subgroup of all elements expressible as (finite) combinations of elements in $A$ and their inverses.
* <span style="color:gray">(Top-down).</span> We can let $\gen{A}$ be the intersection of all subgroup $H\substructeq G$ containing $A$. Since intersections of subgroups are subgroups, this makes $\gen{A}$ the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $A$, as desired.
* <span style="color:gray">(Bottom-up).</span> We can construct $\gen{A}$ starting with $A\cup\l\\{e\r\\}$ by inductively closing it under the group operation and inversion. Only a countable induction is needed, and this construction generalizes{{< link file="substructure" mod="dag" type="generalizations" section="Substructure Generation" >}} to arbitrary substructures.
* <span style="color:gray">(Free Construction).</span> A {{< link file="category" display="category" type="references" >}}-theoretic construction is given by setting $\gen{A}$ be the image of the canonical map{{< link file="free_group" mod="dag" type="references" >}} $F(A)\to G$ induced by the inclusion $A\into G$.

The {{< link file="cyclic_group" display="cyclic" type="constructions" >}} groups are those that can be generated by a single element, and are thus one of the simplest types of groups. More generally, the {{< link file="finitely_generated_group" display="finitely-generated" type="constructions" >}} groups are those that can be generated by a finite subset thereof.

## {{< link file="normal_subgroup" display="Normal Subgroup" type="types" >}}

Let $H\substructeq G$ and consider the equivalence relation $\sim$ of $G$ defined by $g_1\sim g_2$ iff $g_1H=g_2H$. We would like to equip the {{< link file="quotient_set" display="quotient set" type="references" >}} $G/\\!\sim$ with a group structure, but the {{< link file="equivalence_relation" display="equivalence relation" type="references" >}} $\sim$ fails to be a {{< link file="congruence_relation" display="congruence" type="references" >}}.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;It turns out, fortunately, that $\sim$ is a congruence precisely{{< link file="normal_subgroup" type="justifications" mod="dag" section="Normal $\Leftrightarrow$ Congruence" >}} if $H$ satisfies an extra group-theoretic condition $-$ namely, that $H$ is invariant under the {{< link file="conjugation_action" display="conjugation" type="references" >}} {{< link file="group_action" display="action" type="references" >}} of $G$, i.e. $gH=Hg$ for all $g\in G$. In this case, we say that $H$ is *normal* in $G$.

# Lattice of Subgroups

## {{< link file="subgroup_products" display="Product of Subgroups" type="justifications" >}}

For subgroups $H,K\substructeq G$, their *subgroup product* is the subset $HK\coloneqq\l\\{hk\in G\st h\in H,k\in K\r\\}$ of $G$. There are several sufficient criteria for $HK\substructeq G$; the most basic of which is that $HK\substructeq G$ iff $HK=KH$. In particular, this holds when $G$ is {{< link file="abelian_group" display="abelian" type="references" >}}, or more generally, if $H\substructeq N_G(K)$ (or $K\substructeq N_G(H)$).

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Subgroups of $G$ also form a {{< link file="lattice" display="lattice" type="references" >}} whose meets are intersections and whose joins are $\gen{H,H'}\coloneqq\gen{H\cup H'}$.
