``` ad-Proposition
title: Proposition.

_Let $X$ be a set and let $R$ be a binary relation. If $R$ is irreflexive and transitive on $X$, then $R$ is asymmetric on $X$._

``` 

_Proof_. If $xRy$ and $yRx$, then, by transitivity, we have $xRx$. This contradicts the fact that $R$ is irreflexive on $X$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
