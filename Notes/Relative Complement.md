title: Definition.

Let $u$ and $v$ be sets. The **relative complement of $u$ w.r.t. $v$** is the set
$$\begin{equation}
    v\comp u\coloneqq\l\{x\in v\mid x\not\in u\r\}.
\end{equation}$$

```

<b>Remark.</b> Trivially, we have $v\comp u\subseteq v$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
