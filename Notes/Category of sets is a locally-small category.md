title: Proposition.

_The category of sets $\catset$ is a locally-small category._

```

_Proof_. The fact that the composition function is associative and that compositions with identities preserve functions are proved; see links above. For the assertion that $\catset$ is locally-small, recall that for all sets $X$ and $Y$, we have $\hom\l(X,Y\r)=Y^X$ which is a set.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
