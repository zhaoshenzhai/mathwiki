title: Definition.

_Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be a topological space and fix $S\subseteq X$. The **closure of $S$ in $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$** is the intersection of all closed sets that contain $S$; that is,_
$$\begin{equation}
    \bar{S}\coloneqq\bigcap\l\{C\in\mc{F}\mid S\subseteq C\r\}
\end{equation}$$
_where $\mc{F}$ is the set of all closed sets of $X$._

```

**Remark.** Obviously, $S\subseteq\bar{S}$; the converse holds iff $S$ is closed.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
