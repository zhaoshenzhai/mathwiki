title: Proposition.

Let $\tpl{X,\leq}$ be a complete lattice. Then $\tpl{X,\leq}$ is bounded.

```

<i>Proof.</i> In particular, we have $X\subseteq X$ and thus $\bigvee X$ and $\bigwedge X$ exist. Because the join and meet of $X$ are also upper and lower bounds of $X$, respectively, we see that
$$\begin{equation}
    \fa x\in X:\bigwedge X\leq x\leq\bigvee X.\qedin
\end{equation}$$
