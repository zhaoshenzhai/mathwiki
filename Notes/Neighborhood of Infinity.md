title: Definition.

Let $\tpl{X,\mc{T}}$ be an ordered topological space.
* If $X$ is unbounded above, then half-infinite open ray of the form $\l(a,+\infty\r)$ where $a\in X$ is said to be a <b>neighborhood of $+\infty$</b>.
* If $X$ is unbounded below, then half-infinite open ray of the form $\l(-\infty,b\r)$ where $b\in X$ is said to be a <b>neighborhood of $-\infty$</b>.
