``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space. The **dimension of $V$** is $\dim_K\!V\coloneqq\l|\mc{B}\r|$ where $\mc{B}\subseteq V$ is any basis for $V$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Depending on how one defines a basis $\mc{B}$ for $V$, this definition is justified by the following:
1. Every vector space has a basis, so we may talk about <i>a</i> cardinality.
2. All bases of a vector space, being minimal spanning sets/maximal linearly independent sets, have the same cardinality, so we may talk about <i>the</i> cardinality.

These facts are non-trivial for the infinite-dimensional case.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
