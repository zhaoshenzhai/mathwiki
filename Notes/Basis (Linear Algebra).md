title: Definition.

_Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space. An indexed subset_ $\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\{b_i\r\}_{i\in I}\subseteq V$ _is said to be a **(algebraic) basis for $V$** if $\mc{B}$ is a linearly independent spanning set of $V$._

```

**Remark.** If $I$ carries a total order, then $\mc{B}$ inherits this order and is hence said to be an **ordered (algebraic) basis for $V$**. Abusing notation, if $I=\l\{1,\dots,n\r\}$ for some $n\in\N$, we write $\mc{B}=\l\{b_1,\dots,b_n\r\}$ which is understood to be ordered. Similarly, if $I=\N$, we write $\mc{B}=\l\{b_1,b_2,\dots\r\}$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
