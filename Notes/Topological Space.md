``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $X$ be a set. A **topology on $X$** is a family $\mc{T}\subseteq\pow\l(X\r)$ such that
* $\em,X\in\mc{T}$.
* Arbitrary unions of elements in $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$.
* Finite intersections of elements in $\mc{T}$ are in $\mc{T}$.

The set $X$, equipped with a topology $\mc{T}$ on $X$, is called a **topological space**.
