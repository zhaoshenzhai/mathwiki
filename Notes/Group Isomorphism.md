``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups. We say that $G$ and $H$ are <b>isomorphic as groups</b> if there exists an invertible group homomorphism $\phi:G\to H$, called a <b>group isomorphism</b>.

```

<b>Remark.</b> That is, group isomorphisms are isomorphisms in $\catgrp$. Since $\textrm{`}$is isomorphic to$\textrm{'}$ is an equivalence relation, we shall write $G\iso H$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
