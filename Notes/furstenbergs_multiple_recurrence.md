Let $(X,\mu,T)$ be a \ref[measure-preserving dynamical system]{measure-preserving_dynamical_system}. 

\begin{theorem}[Furstenberg's Multiple Recurrence \cite{Fur97}]\label{recurrence}

For any positive measure set $A\subeq X$ and any $k\geq1$, there exists $n\geq1$ such that $\mu(\bigcap_{i<k}T^{-in}A)>0$.

\end{theorem}

The case $k=1$ is trivial, and the case $k=2$ is \ref[Poincar√©'s Recurrence Theorem]{poincares_recurrence_theorem}. Innocuous as the statement might seem, the proof is orders of magnitude harder and requires the following structure theorem for ergodic systems.

\begin{fact}[\ref[Furstenberg-Zimmer Structure Theorem]{}]

\TODO[very hard!!]

\end{fact}

\begin{proof}[of Theorem \iref{recurrence}]

\TODO

\end{proof}
