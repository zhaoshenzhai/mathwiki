title: Definition.

Let $G$ be a group and fix a subset $H\subseteq G$. Then $H$ is a <b>subgroup of $G$</b> if $H$ is a group under the induced operations, in which case we write $H\subgrpeq G$.

```

<b>Remark.</b> It is clear that $H\subseteq G$ is a subgroup of $G$ iff $0\in H$ and that $H$ is closed under $\ast$ and inversion.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
