title: Definition.

_Let $\cat{C}$ be a category and fix $X,Y\in\obj\l(\cat{C}\r)$. A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is an **isomorphism in $\cat{C}$** if $f$ has an inverse._

```

**Remark.** If there exists an isomorphism $f:X\to Y$, write $X\iso Y$ and say that $X$ and $Y$ are **isomorphic as objects in $\cat{C}$**.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
