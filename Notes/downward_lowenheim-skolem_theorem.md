# Statement and Proof

\begin{theorem}\label{downward_lowenheim-skolem}

Let $L$ be a \ref[first-order language]{first-order_language} and let $M$ be an infinite \ref[$L$-structure]{model}. For any subset $A\subeq M$, there is an elementary substructure $N\esubeq M$ containing $A$ such that $|N|\leq|A|+|L|+\aleph_0$.

\end{theorem}

&emsp;&emsp;In order to generate a substructure $N\subseq M$ containing $A$, we need to close $A$ under constants and function applications. Here, we need to do a bit more and also close $A$ under witnesses of quantifiers:

\begin{fact}[\ref[Tarski-Vaught Test]{tarski-vaught_test}]\label{tarski-vaught}

Let $N\subseq M$ be $L$-structures. Then $N\esubeq M$ iff for every formula $\phi(\bar{x},y)$ and for every $\bar{a}\in N$, we have $M\models\ex y\phi(\bar{a},y)$ iff $M\models\phi(\bar{a},a)$ for some $a\in N$.

\end{fact}

\begin{proof}[of Theorem \iref{downward_lowenheim-skolem}]

Set $\kappa\coloneqq|A|+|L|+\aleph_0$. We construct $L$-structures $N_\alpha\subseq M$ for $\alpha<\kappa$ by induction, starting with $N_0\coloneqq\l\langle A\r\rangle$. Given $N_\alpha$, for every $\bar{a}\in N_\alpha$ and formula $\phi(\bar{x},y)$ such that $M\models\ex y\phi(\bar{a},y)$, choose a witness $a\in M$ and let $N_{\alpha+1}$ be the substructure of $M$ generated by $N_\alpha$ and the union of those witnesses. Setting $N\coloneqq\bigcup_{\alpha<\kappa}N_\alpha$ makes $N\esubeq M$ by Fact \iref{tarski-vaught}, and clearly $|N|\leq\kappa$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>
