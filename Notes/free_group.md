# Motivation & Definition

Fix a set $X$. We would like to ‘canonically’ construct a group $F(X)$ containing $X$ ‘in the most efficient way’. The latter is encoded by a {{< link file="universal_constructions" display="universal property" type="references" >}}, and the former makes $F:\catset\to\catgrp$ a {{< link file="adjunction" display="left-adjoint" type="references" >}} to the forgetful {{< link file="functor" display="functor" type="references" >}} $U:\catgrp\to\catset$.


{{< env type="definition" >}}

A *free group* on $X$ is a group $F(X)$ equipped with a function $j:X\to F(X)$ that is universal in the following sense:

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For every group $G$ and any function $f:X\to UG$, there is a unique group homomorphism $f':F(X)\to G$ such that $Ff'\circ j=f$.

## Categorical Properties

In other words, $(F(X),j)$ is the universal arrow from $X$ to $U$, and is thus unique up to (unique) isomorphism.
