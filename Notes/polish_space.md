# Basic Properties of Polish Spaces

\begin{fact}[\ref[Preservation]{preservation_of_polish}]

Being Polish is preserved under the following operations.
1. (Subsets). A subset of a Polish space is Polish iff it is $G_\delta$.
2. (Union). Countable disjoint unions of Polish spaces are Polish.
3. (Product). Countable products of Polish spaces are Polish.

\end{fact}
