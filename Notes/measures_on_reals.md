Consider $\R$ equipped with its \ref[order topology]{order_topology}, which admits a subbase of open sets of the form $(-\infty,a)$ and $(a,\infty)$ for $a\in\R$. The \ref[Borel $\sigma$-algebra]{measurable_space#borel-sigma-algebra} $\mc{B}_\R$ on $\R$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by said topology.
