$\huge\rm\bf{R}\normalsize\rm\bf{EAL ANALYSIS}$ is the study of limiting behaviours of [sequences](Sequences%20in%20R.md), [series](Infinite%20Series.md), and [functions](Functions%20in%20R.md) in [$\R$](Real%20Numbers.md); that is, the study of [sequential](Sequential%20Limits%20in%20R.md)/[functional](Functional%20Limits%20in%20R.md) convergence, [continuity](Continuous%20Function%20in%20R.md), [differentiability](Differentiable%20Function%20slash%20Derivative%20in%20R.md), and [integrability](obsidian://open?file=TODO) in $\R$.

**Constructions.** As with all metric spaces, one can define [sequential](Sequential%20Limits%20in%20R.md)/[functional](Functional%20Limits%20in%20R.md) limits in $\R$, ([uniform](Uniform%20Continuity.md)/[Lipschitz](Lipschitz%20Continuity.md)) [continuous](Continuous%20Function%20in%20R.md) functions in $\R$, and other topological properties such that [compactness](Compact%20Space.md) and [connectedness](obsidian://open?file=TODO). Furthermore, as with all normed vector spaces, one can define [differentiable](Differentiable%20Function%20slash%20Derivative%20in%20R.md) functions in $\R$.

Unique to $\R$ is a that it is a [Dedekind-complete](Dedekind-complete%20Ordered%20Set.md) ordered field, allowing us to establish the [Nested Interval Theorem](Nested%20Interval%20Theorem.md), [Monotone Convergence Theorem](Monotone%20Convergence%20Theorem.md), and the [Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem](Bolzano-Weierstrass%20Theorem.md).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Characterizations.** As with all metric spaces, functional limits can be [characterized](Sequential%20Criterion%20for%20Functional%20Limits.md) in terms of sequential limits, which, in turn, [characterizes](Sequential%20slash%20functional%20limit%20characterizations%20of%20continuity.md) continuous functions. Unique to $\R$ is that it is [metric-complete](Metric-completeness%20of%20R.md), so a sequence converges $\Leftrightarrow$ it is Cauchy.
* Furthermore, one may use the order structure on $\R$ to define the [limit superior$/$inferior](Limit%20Superior%20slash%20Inferior.md) of a bounded sequence, which can be [characterized](Criteria%20for%20limit%20superior%20slash%20inferior.md) in several ways, and the [limits coincide $\Leftrightarrow$ the sequence converges](Convergence%20Criteria%20in%20R.md).

Differentiable functions in $\R$ can also be characterized in terms of the [Fundamental Increment Lemma](Fundamental%20Increment%20Lemma.md) and [Carath$\acute{\textrm{e}}$odory$\textrm{'}$s Criterion](Caratheodory's%20Differentation%20Criterion.md).<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Computations.** Both [sequential limits](Sequential%20Limit%20Theorems%20in%20R.md) and [functional limits](Functional%20Limit%20Theorems%20in%20R.md) respect the field and order structures of $\R$. This, in tandem with the [Squeezed Distance Lemma](Squeezed%20Distance%20Lemma.md) and tests such as the [Ratio](Ratio%20Test%20(Sequence).md) and [Comparison](Comparison%20Test%20(Sequence).md) tests, is able to determine the convergence of many sequences, and, in some cases, their value too.<span style="float:right;">$\blacklozenge$</span>
