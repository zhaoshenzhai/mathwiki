title: Definition.

_Let $a,b\in\Z\comp\l\{0\r\}$. An element $m\in\Z\comp\l\{0\r\}$ is said to be a **least common multiple of $a$ and $b$** if_
* _$m$ is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$; that is, if $a\divides m$ and $b\divides m$, and_
* _for all common multiples $m'$ of $a$ and $b$, $m\divides m'$._

_The least common multiple of $a$ and $b$, is, up to sign, unique; write $\lcm\l(a,b\r)\coloneqq\l|m\r|$._
