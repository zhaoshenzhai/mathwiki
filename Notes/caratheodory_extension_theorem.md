# Statement and some Setup

Let $X$ be a set. Starting from a 'measure' $\mu_0$ on an algebra $\mc{A}\subeq\pow(X)$, we will extend $\mu$ to a genuine measure $\mu$ on the \ref[$\sigma$-algebra]{measurable_space} $\l\langle\mc{A}\r\rangle_\sigma$ generated by $\mc{A}$. 'Measures' on an algebra $\mc{A}$ are called _premeasures_.

\begin{definition_}\label{premeasure}

A _premeasure_ on an algebra $\mc{A}$ is a finitely-additive map $\mu:\mc{A}\to[0,\infty]$ such that $\mu(\e)=0$.

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Carathéodory's Extension Theorem]\label{theorem}

Let $X$ be a set. Every $\sigma$-finite premeasure $\mu_0$ on an algebra $\mc{A}\subeq\pow(X)$ admits a unique extension to a \ref[measure]{measure} $\mu:\l\langle\mc{A}\r\rangle_\sigma\to[0,\infty]$. Moreover:
1. The $\sigma$-algebra $\mc{B}\coloneqq\bar{\mc{A}}$ obtained by \ref[completing]{metric_completion} $\mc{A}$ under $d(A_1,A_2)\coloneqq\mu(A_1\symdiff A_2)$ coincides with \ref[$\Meas_\mu$]{measurable_set}.
2. For each $\mu$-measurable set $B$ and $\epsilon>0$, there is some $A\in\mc{A}$ such that $\mu(A\symdiff B)<\epsilon$.
3. For each $\mu$-measurable set $B$ and $\epsilon>0$, there exist $A_n\in\mc{A}$ such that $B\subeq\bigcup_nA_n$ and $\mu(B)\approx_\epsilon\mu(\bigcup_nA_n)$.

\end{theorem}

## Outer measures

The construction of $\mu$ from $\mu_0$ will require the following technical tool.

\begin{definition_}

Let $\mc{A}\subeq\pow(X)$ be any collection of sets such that $\e\in\mc{A}$ and $X=\bigcup\mc{A}$, and let $\mu:\mc{A}\to[0,\infty]$ be a map. The _outer measure_ induced by $\mu$ is the map $\mu^\ast:\pow(X)\to[0,\infty]$ defined by $\mu^\ast(S)\coloneqq\inf\sum_n\mu(A_n)$, where the infimum ranges over all countable covers $\l\\{A_n\r\\}$ of $S$ in $\mc{A}$.

\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{outer}

For any $\mu:\mc{A}\to[0,\infty]$, its outer measure $\mu^\ast$ satisfies $\mu^\ast(\e)=0$ and is:
* monotone: for all $A,B\in\pow(X)$ with $A\subeq B$, we have $\mu^\ast(A)\leq\mu^\ast(B)$.
* countably subadditive: for all $B_n\in\pow(X)$, we have $\mu^\ast(\bigcup_nB_n)\leq\sum_n\mu^\ast(B_n)$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Since $\mc{A}$ covers $X$, the definition makes sense, and $\mu^\ast(\e)=0$ by covering $\e$ by empty sets, which lie in $\mc{A}$ by assumption. If $A\subeq B$, then $\mu^\ast(A)\leq\mu^\ast(B)$ since any cover of $B$ is a cover of $A$.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;For countable subadditivity, let $\l\\{B\_n\r\\}$ be a countable family of subsets of $X$ and take $\epsilon>0$. For each $n$, there is a cover $\l\\{C\_{n,m}\r\\}\_{m<\omega}\subeq\mc{A}$ of $B\_n$ such that $\sum\_m\mu(C\_{n,m})\approx\_{\epsilon/2^n}\mu^\ast(B\_n)$. Summing over all $n<\omega$ gives us
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_{n,m}\mu(C_{n,m})\approx_\epsilon\sum_n\mu^\ast(B_n),
\end{equation*}
but since $\l\\{C_{n,m}\r\\}_{n,m}\subeq\mc{A}$ is a cover of $\bigcup_nB_n$, we see that
\begin{equation*}
    \mu^\ast\l(\bigcup\nolimits_nB_n\r)\leq\sum\_{n,m}\mu(C\_{n,m})\leq\sum_n\mu^\ast(B_n)+\epsilon.
\end{equation*}
Since $\epsilon$ was arbitrary, we have $\mu^\ast(\bigcup_nB_n)\leq\sum_n\mu^\ast(B_n)$, as desired.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{outer_restriction_premeasure}

For any algebra $\mc{A}$ on $X$ and premeasure $\mu:\mc{A}\to[0,\infty]$, we have $\l.\mu^\ast\r|_\mc{A}=\mu$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Take $A\in\mc{A}$. We wish to show that for any cover $\l\\{A_n\r\\}\subeq\mc{A}$ of $A$, we have $\mu(A)\leq\sum_n\mu(A_n)$. To this end, we may assume that each $A_n\subeq A$ by replacing $A_n$ by $A_n\cap A$ and noting that $\mu(A_n\cap A)\leq\mu(A_n)$ by Lemma \iref{outer}.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Now $A=\bigcup_nA_n$, so by disjointifying, we may assume that $A=\bigsqcup_nA_n$, whence $\mu(A)=\sum_n\mu(A_n)$ by countable additivity of $\mu$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

\end{proof}

# Statements and proofs

We are now ready to prove Carathéodory's Extension Theorem. To this end, we define a pseudometric $d$ on $\pow(X)$ by $d(A,B)\coloneqq\mu^\ast(A\symdiff B)$. This is clearly symmetric, and the triangle inequality holds since
\begin{equation*}
    d(A,C)=\mu^\ast(A\symdiff C)\leq\mu^\ast((A\symdiff B)\cup(B\symdiff C))\leq d(A,B)+d(B,C)
\end{equation*}
by Lemma \iref{outer}. Let $\mc{B}\coloneqq\bar{\mc{A}}$ be the completion of $\mc{A}$ under $d$. The existence of the desired measure $\mu$ will be obtained by showing that $\mc{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra such that $\mu^\ast$ is finitely-additive on $\mc{B}$, since then $\mu^\ast|\mc{B}$ is countably-supadditive by Fact \TODO, and $\mu^\ast|\mc{B}$ is already countably-subadditive by Lemma \iref{outer}.

## Existence

First, we can assume without loss of generality that $\mu_0$ is finite, since partitioning $X=\bigsqcup_nX_n$ with each $\mu(X_n)<\infty$, the existence of an extension of $\mu_0$ to $\l\langle\mc{A}\r\rangle_\sigma$ follows by extending $\mu_0$ to $\l\langle\mc{A}\_{\cap X\_n}\r\rangle_\sigma$ for each $n$.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;In this case, we will establish that $\mc{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra such that $\mu^\ast|\mc{B}$ is finitely-additive with the following claims.
