Throughout, fix a \ref[first-order language]{first-order_language} $L$.

# Definitions

\begin{definition}

An \ref[$L$-theory]{theory} $T$ is _Skolem_ (or _has built-in Skolem functions_) if for every $L$-formula $\phi(\bar{x},y)$, there exists $f_\phi\in\mc{F}$ such that $T\models\fa\bar{x}(\ex y\phi(\bar{x},y)\rightarrow\phi(x,f_\phi(\bar{x})))$; any such $f_\phi$ is said to be a _Skolem function_ for $\phi$.

\end{definition}

## Skolemization

A _Skolemization_ of an $L$-theory $T$ is an Skolem theory $T^\ast\supseteq T$ over some language $L^\ast\supseteq L$.

\begin{theorem}

Every \ref[consistent]{theory#consistency-and-completeness} $L$-theory $T$ admits a consistent Skolemization $T^\ast\supseteq T$, defined over a language $L^\ast\supseteq L$ such that $|L^\ast|\leq|L|+\aleph_0$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Let $L^\ast\coloneqq\bigcup\_{n<\omega}L\_n$, where $L\_0\coloneqq L$ and $L\_{n+1}$ is the language obtained by adjoining to $L_n$ fresh functions $f_\phi$ with arity $|\bar{x}|$ for each $L_n$-formula $\phi(\bar{x},y)$. For each $n<\omega$, we define an $L_n$-theory $T_n$ by induction, setting $T_0\coloneqq T$ and letting $T_{n+1}$ be $T_n$ adjoined with the formulas $\fa\bar{x}(\ex y\phi(\bar{x},y)\rightarrow\phi(x,f_\phi(\bar{x})))$ for each $L_n$-formula $\phi$.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;By construction, $T^\ast\coloneqq\bigcup_nT_n$ is a Skolem theory and $|L^\ast|\leq|L|+\aleph_0$. It remains to see that if $T_n$ is consistent, then so is $T_{n+1}$, for then $T^\ast$ is consistent too. Indeed, since $T_n$ is consistent, let $M\models T_n$ be a model and interpret, for each $L_n$-formula $\phi$, the function $f_\phi$ by choosing witnesses in $M$ to $M\models\ex y\phi(\bar{a},y)$ for $\bar{a}\in M$, if any.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

\end{proof}

## Skolem hull

Let $M$ be an $L$-structure and fix a subset $A\subeq M$. If $T\coloneqq\Th(M)$ is a Skolem theory, then the $L$-substructure of $M$ generated by $A$ is an \ref[elementary substructure]{elementarity} of $M$, denoted $\mc{H}(A)\esubeq M$; this follows from the proof of the \ref[Downward LÃ¶wenheim-Skolem Theorem]{downward_lowenheim-skolem_theorem}.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Otherwise, we can Skolemize $T$ to an $L^\ast$-theory $T^\ast$ and consider $\mc{H}(A)\esubeq M^\ast$, in which case $\mc{H}(A)$ is called a _Skolem hull_ of $A$. Note that $\mc{H}(A)$ depends highly on the particular Skolemization of $T$, of which there are many.
