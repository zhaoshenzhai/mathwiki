# Motivation & Definition

Let $X$ be a set. To specify a {{< link file="topological_space" display="topology" type="references" >}} on $X$, one needs to give a complete description of its open sets, but in practice, certain subcollections suffice. Two questions arise:
1. If $\mc{T}$ is a *given* topology on $X$, what subcollections $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}$ completely specify $\mc{T}$?
2. What kinds of collections $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow(X)$ can specify *some* topology $\mc{T}$ on $X$?

In either case, we say that $\mc{T}$ is *generated by* $\mc{B}$.

## Generation of a Fixed Topology

Let $\mc{T}$ be a topology on $X$.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A collection $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}$ is a **basis for $\mc{T}$** if every open set $U\in\mc{T}$ is a union of sets in $\mc{B}$.

{{< /env >}}

Equivalently, $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow(X)$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$ iff for each $x\in X$, its neighborhood {{< link file="filter" display="filter" type="references" >}} $\mc{N}_x$ (of all sets $A\subseteq X$ such that $x\in U\subseteq A$ for some $U\in\mc{T}$) admits a {{< link file="filter" display="filter base" type="references" section="base" >}} in $\mc{B}$.

>{{< env type="proof" hide="true" >}}

If $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}$ is a basis and $x\in X$, then $\l\\{V\in\mc{B}\st x\in V\r\\}$ is a filter base for $\mc{N}_x$. Conversely, let $U$ be open. Every $x\in U$ admits a filter base $\mc{B}_x\subseteq\mc{B}$, giving us for each $x\in U$ some $B_x\in\mc{B}_x\subseteq\mc{B}$ with $x\in B_x\subseteq U$, so that $U=\bigcup\_{x\in U}B_x$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

{{< /env >}}

Since all open sets $U\in\mc{T}$ are just unions of sets in $\mc{B}$, we call $\mc{B}$ the *basic open sets*.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Thus $\mc{T}$ is obtained from $\mc{B}$ by closing under unions. To further thin down the subcollection and obtain $\mc{T}$ by closing under finite intersections as well, we need:

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A collection $\mc{S}\subseteq\mc{T}$ is a **subbasis for $\mc{T}$** if every open set $U\in\mc{T}$ is a union of finite intersections of sets in $\mc{S}$.

{{< /env >}}

Note that $\mc{B}\_\mc{S}\coloneqq\l\\{\bigcap\_{i=1}^nU\_i\st U\_i\in\mc{S},n\in\N\r\\}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}$.

## Generation of Some Topology

For a subcollection $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow(X)$ to generate *some* topology on $X$, it certainly must not violate any of the axioms of a topology on $X$. Thus, we have different levels of generating a topology, obtained by including only some of the axioms, and closing it satisfy the others.

{{< env type="definition" >}}

A collection $\mc{B}\subseteq\pow(X)$ is a **(saturated) basis** for a topology if $X$ and all pairwise intersections of sets in $\mc{B}$ are unions of sets in $\mc{B}$ (resp. in $\mc{B}$).

{{< /env >}}

In other words, $\mc{B}$ is a basis if it covers $X$ and for every $B_1,B_2\in\mc{B}$ with $x\in B_1\cap B_2$, we have $x\in B\subseteq B_1\cap B_2$ for some $B\in\mc{B}$. In either case, we obtain a topology on $X$ as $\mc{T}_\mc{B}\coloneqq\l\\{U\subseteq X\st\fa x\in U,\ex B\in\mc{B},x\in B\subseteq U\r\\}$, in which case $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}\_\mc{B}$.

>{{< env type="proof" hide="true" >}}

Since every saturated basis is a basis, we prove it $\mc{B}$ is just a basis. That $\em\in\mc{T}\_\mc{B}$ is vacuous, and $X\in\mc{T}\_\mc{B}$ since $\mc{B}$ covers $X$. Closure under arbitrary unions is clear. If $U_1,U_2\in\mc{T}\_\mc{B}$ and $x\in U\_1\cap U\_2$, then $x\in B\_i\subseteq U\_i$ for $i=1,2$ for some $B\_1,B\_2\in\mc{B}$, and so $x\in B\subseteq B_1\cap B_2\subseteq U_1\cap U_2$ for some $B\in\mc{B}$.

<br>

&emsp;&emsp;Finally, $\mc{B}$ is a basis for $\mc{T}_\mc{B}$ since every $U\in\mc{T}$ can be written as $U=\bigcup\_{x\in U}B\_x$, where each $B_x\in\mc{B}$ is such that $x\in B_x\subseteq U$.<span style="float:right;">$\blacksquare$</span>

{{< /env >}}

One can be more vigorous by removing all the axioms of a topology and consider *any* subcollection $\mc{S}\subseteq\pow(X)$. This induces a (saturated) basis $\mc{B}_\mc{S}$ consisting of finite intersections of sets in $\mc{S}$, from which we obtain a topology $\mc{T}_{\mc{B}_\mc{S}}$.

# Rigidity of Bases/Subbases

Many topological properties of $X$ can be detected by bases/subbases thereof.
