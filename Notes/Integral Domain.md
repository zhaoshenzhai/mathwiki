``` ad-Definition
title: Definition.

A ring $R$ is an <b>integral domain</b> if it is a commutative ring with $0\neq1$ having no <b>zero divisors</b>; that is, non-zero elements $r,s\in R$ whose product vanishes.

```

<b>Remark.</b> Equivalently, a commutative ring with $0\neq1$ is an integral domain if $rs=rt$ implies $s=t$ for all $s,t\in R$ and non-zero $r\in R$.
