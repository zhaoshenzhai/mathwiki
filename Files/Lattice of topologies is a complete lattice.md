!!! ad-Proposition Proposition.

Let $X$ be a set. Then the pair $\l\langle\Sigma,\subseteq\r\rangle$, where $\Sigma$ is the set of all topologies on $X$, is a complete lattice.

--- admonition

_Proof_. Observe that $\l\langle\Sigma,\subseteq\r\rangle$ is a poset, so it suffices to prove that every collection of topologies on $X$ has both a join and a meet. To this end, take $\ms{T}\subseteq\Sigma$. If $\ms{T}=\em$, then every topology $\mc{T}$ on $X$ is vacuously an upper and lower bound on $\ms{T}$.
* For the join of $\em$, simply take the trivial topology $\mc{T}_\textrm{trivial}$ on $X$ since $\fa\mc{T}\in\Sigma:\mc{T}_\textrm{trivial}\subseteq\mc{T}$.
* For the meet of $\em$, simply take the discrete topology $\mc{T}_\textrm{discrete}$ on $X$ since $\fa\mc{T}\in\Sigma:\mc{T}\subseteq\mc{T}_\textrm{discrete}$.

Assume now that $\ms{T}\neq\em$.
* We claim that $\bigvee\ms{T}=\mc{T}\l(\bigcup\ms{T}\r)$ where $\bigcup\ms{T}$ is regarded as a subbasis of a topology on $X$. To see that $\mc{S}\coloneqq\bigcup\ms{T}$ covers $X$, observe that $X\in\mc{S}$ since $X\in\mc{T}$ for all $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$ and hence $X\subseteq\bigcup\mc{S}$.
    * To show that $\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)$ is an upper bound, take any $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$ and $U\in\mc{T}$. Clearly, we have $U\in\bigcup\ms{T}=\mc{S}$. Let $\mc{B}$ be the collection of all finite intersections of $\mc{S}$, so $\mc{S}\subseteq\mc{B}$. Observe that $\mc{B}\subseteq\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}\r)=\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)$, so $U\in\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)$ too. Thus $\mc{T}\subseteq\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)$ for all $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$.
    * To show that $\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)$ is the least upper bound, suppose that $\mc{T}_u\in\ms{T}$ is a topology on $X$ that contains every $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$. Take $U\in\mc{T}\l(\mc{S}\r)=\mc{T}\l(\mc{B}\r)$, so there exists $\mc{A}\subseteq\mc{B}$ such that $U=\bigcup\mc{A}$. We wish to show that $\bigcup\mc{A}\in\mc{T}_u$, for then $U\in\mc{T}_u$ and we are done. To do so, it suffices so, it suffices to show that $\mc{A}\subseteq\mc{T}_u$ for then the result follows from $\axitop{2}$ of $\mc{T}_u$. Take $W\in\mc{A}$, so $W\in\mc{B}$ and, by definition of the topology generated by $\mc{S}$, there exists a non-empty finite subset $\mc{R}\subseteq\mc{S}$ such that $W=\bigcap\mc{R}$. It follows that each $R\in\mc{R}$ is an element of $\mc{S}=\bigcup\ms{T}$, so $R\in\mc{T}$ for some $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$. By hypothesis, we have $\mc{T}\subseteq\mc{T}_u$, so $R\in\mc{T}_u$ too. It follows that $\mc{R}\subseteq\mc{T}_u$, and since $0<\l|\mc{R}\r|<\infty$, we see, from $\axitop{3}$ of $\mc{T}_u$, that $\bigcap\mc{R}=W\in\mc{T}_u$. Thus $A\subseteq\mc{T}_u$ and we are done.
* We claim that $\bigwedge\ms{T}=\bigcap\ms{T}$.
    * Recall that $\bigcap\ms{T}\subseteq\mc{T}$ for all $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$, so $\bigcap\ms{T}$ is a lower bound of $\ms{T}$.
    * To show that $\bigcap\ms{T}$ is the greatest lower bound, suppose that $\mc{T}_l\in\ms{T}$ is a topology on $X$ that is contains by every $\mc{T}\in\ms{T}$. The result follows from the following chain of equivalences:$$\begin{equation}
    \begin{alignedat}{2}
        \fa\mc{T}\in\ms{T}:\mc{T}_l\subseteq\mc{T}&\Leftrightarrow\fa\mc{T}\in\ms{T},\fa U\in\mc{T}_l:U\in\mc{T}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &&\textrm{Definition of subset}\\
        &\Leftrightarrow\fa U\in\mc{T}_l,\fa\mc{T}\in\ms{T}:U\in\mc{T}&&\textrm{Like quantifiers commute}\\
        &\Leftrightarrow\fa U\in\mc{T}_l:U\in\bigcap\ms{T}&&\textrm{Definition of intersection}\\
        &\Leftrightarrow\mc{T}_l\subseteq\bigcap\ms{T}.&&\textrm{Definition of subset}
    \end{alignedat}
 \end{equation}$$
 
Overall, we have
$$\begin{equation}
    \bigvee\ms{T}=
        \begin{dcases}
            \mc{T}_\textrm{trivial} & \textrm{if }\ms{T}=\em\\\ \\
            \mc{T}\l(\bigcup\ms{T}\r) & \textrm{else}
        \end{dcases}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{and}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \bigwedge\ms{T}=
        \begin{dcases}
            \mc{T}_\textrm{discrete} & \textrm{if }\ms{T}=\em\\\ \\
            \bigcap\ms{T} & \textrm{else.}
        \end{dcases}\qedin
\end{equation}$$
